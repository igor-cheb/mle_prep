This is an excercise to explore, process and build prediction model based on a simple dataset with geospatial features.
Label to predict here is `potential_kwh_total`.

1. EDA - freeflow exploration of dataset
2. ETL - data transformation based on TODO's created in EDA
3. model_experiments - several simple prediction models built on top of dataset produced in ETL
