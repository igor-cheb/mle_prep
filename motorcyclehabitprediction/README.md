This is a quick and dirty and late solution for the Motorcycle_habit_prediction kaggle competition. Intended to practice building a simple arch. NN classifier model with PyTorch and wraping it in sklearn pipeline.

Project structure:
- data: raw data and submissions
- src: varous classes and utilities used for modelling
- notebooks:
-- EDA: data exploration
-- pathfinder_ETL: sandbox for iterating on ETL pipeline structure
-- modelling: sandbox for modelling epxeriements and saving kaggle predictions
